# AgentDojo — the real injections ODILE trained on (verbatim)

These are the exact attacker injections in ODILE's training traces, per suite. Compare against the InjecAgent and TensorTrust lists: the training attacks are banking money-transfer, data exfiltration via AgentDojo tools, etc. — the held-out benchmarks above share no surface form, domain, or tooling with these.
